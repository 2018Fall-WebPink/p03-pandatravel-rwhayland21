    <blockquote> "I've heard elevators running by themselves, doors have actually pushed open on 
        me as I've tried to close them," said Jeff Hartzog, owner of the Cuban Club.
    </blockquote>
    
    <blockquote> “One can make a case, if one accepts the paranormal, that this place has some 
        activity going on," said Joe Howden, with Ybor City Ghost Tours.</blockquote>
    
    <blockquote> "The rational mind would say it was probably a voice coming from out the 
        sidewalk or radio in an automobile, 'that’s what it was, yeah yeah, that’s what it 
        was,'" he said,  "sure, but when someone very close to you, standing very near you says, 
        ‘come play with me, will you come play with me?' That’ll get your attention.”- Syfy 
        channel's Ghost Hunters</blockquote>

    <h3> Why should you visit?</h3>
        <p> The Cuban Club is in the top ten of most haunted attractions in Florida. The first 
            club burned to the ground in 1916 but they quickley rebuilt a knew one in 1917. The 
            first Cuban Club was a cigar factory that produced many cigars but in the new 
            building it housed a gym, a swimming pool, bowling lanes and a theater. The new club 
            was the place of many deaths. People believed it started to be haunted in 1929 when 
            a young actor took the stage and took his own life. After this actor took his life, 
            many people have died there and people have seen "figures lurking around after 
            hours." If you are looking for a little Halloween getaway or "spook", this place 
            will definetly give it to you!   </p>
